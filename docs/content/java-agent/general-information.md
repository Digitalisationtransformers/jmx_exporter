The JMX Exporter Java agent jar provides access to JMX metrics running as a Java agent within your application.

**Use of the JMX Exporter Java agent is strongly encouraged due to the complex application RMI configuration required when running the Standalone JMX Exporter.**

# Jar File

The JMX Exporter Java agent is packaged in `jmx_prometheus_javaagent-<VERSION>.jar`

# Installation

- [HTTP Mode](http://localhost:1313/java-agent/http_mode/)
- [OpenTelemetry Mode](http://localhost:1313/java-agent/opentelementry_mode/)
- [Combined Mode](http://localhost:1313/java-agent/combined_mode/)
